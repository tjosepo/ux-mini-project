Ever since the introduction of social media platforms such as MySpace, Facebook and Youtube in the 2000, and ever since the rise of smartphones all over the world, our perception of what constitutes meaningful relationships and the way we use our time has shifted dramatically. 

> American spend an average of five and a half hours a day with digital media, more than half of that time on mobile devices. [...] Once out of bed, we check our phones 221 times a day -- an average of every 4.3 minutes. (Weisberg, 2016). 

Social media sites are specifically designed to be addictive. It’s a fact that their creators are not even trying to hide. Steve Jobs himself said that iPads were not allowed in his home to be used by his children because “We think it’s too dangerous for them in effect.” (Yates, 2017).

This was true before the Covid-19 pandemic, but the pandemic has only worsened the problem by making us rely on technology for more things than ever before. Trying to disconnect and spend time away from a screen has never been harder.
