Ever since the introduction of social media platforms such as MySpace, Facebook and Youtube in the 2000, and ever since the rise of smartphones all over the world, our perception of what constitutes meaningful relationships and the way we use our time has shifted dramatically. 

> American spend an average of five and a half hours a day with digital media, more than half of that time on mobile devices. [...] Once out of bed, we check our phones 221 times a day -- an average of every 4.3 minutes. (Weisberg, 2016). 

Social media sites are specifically designed to be addictive. It’s a fact that their creators are not even trying to hide. Steve Jobs himself said that iPads were not allowed in his home to be used by his children because “We think it’s too dangerous for them in effect.” (Yates, 2017).

This was true before the Covid-19 pandemic, but the pandemic has only worsened the problem by making us rely on technology for more things than ever before. Trying to disconnect and spend time away from a screen has never been harder.

## The Problem

Since the start of the lockdown, people spend more and more time inside, screen usage has skyrocketed. While computers and cellphones allow us to socialize and communicate safely problems related to digital screen usage as well as a sedentary lifestyle, may be increasing worldwide. These problems range from poor posture, higher chances of heart disease, acceleration of myopia and many more.

Many well-being apps exist already, however they are all separated, leading to users having to download many different apps. Because of this, low-tech users can feel overwhelmed with the amount of apps they would have to keep up to date with, which can be unmotivating for these users, clashing with the intent of the apps.

A super-app is an ecosystem of many apps, and all have the ability to communicate with each other, streamlined to give the user the best experience possible. Common well-being apps will be integrated into our super-app, which we hope will help everyone attain a healthier lifestyle.

## User Research

### Surveys

To help us understand what people are going through, we distributed short surveys asking about their routines during the pandemic. Specifically, we asked them if they have spent more time online than prior to the pandemic, as well as general lifestyle habits.

### Personnas

Using the results of our surveys, we were able to create user personas that cover the general demographic of our users. Since they are based on information specific to each survey participant such as interest, age and lifestyle, our personas help us identify the needs of our users.

### Journey Maps

Journey maps provide a visualization of how the user interacts with our application and allows us to get an insight on the user's feelings and thought process. This helps us seek out potential design flaws and improve our service.

## Design

### Sketches

We used sketches in the early design phase of our application because they are a quick and efficient way to visualize our ideas. They are in no way representative of our final product, and merely serve as rough reference to our wireframes.

These sketches were also used as the user flow for our app. We wanted to know as soon as possible how the user would interact with the app, as to make it easier to design it later on.

### Wireframes

We created some wireframes based on the sketches that we made so that we could have a higher fidelity representation of our application layout. Notice that the colour palette was decided prior to the wireframe, as the wireframes are using pastel colours, although they are still very undetailed, and the colours are yet to be final.

### Color Palette
The main app does not have one colour that defines it, but each core sub-app has a specific theme applied to it, helping the user quickly identify in the long run, which apps they are using. We chose all pastel colours, as they are unaggressive to the eyes, and calming to look at, which is fit for a health oriented application.

## Typography

Our typography of choice is M PLUS Rounded 1c, designed by Coji Morishita. We chose this font because of its simple and easy to read design. What makes this font stand out from other fonts is its rounded borders. The lack of hard edges gives it a very friendly and non-judging appearance.

### Naming

We chose ‘Breakout’ as the name of our app. This name was chosen because our app’s mission is to help its users break away from their phones. The name came to us after trying to fit ‘break’ into the name of our app, starting with break-away. ‘Breakout’ was the most popular choice, since it has a catchy ring to it, and is easy to remember.

## Conclusion 

What we learned during this project is that super apps can be much more than an application marketplace. After analyzing our responses from our short survey, we learned that studying has contributed the most to screen time usage rising during the pandemic, due to online lessons and assessment. As such, the challenge of creating a “Healthy Screen Habits Super App” was to not fall into the pithole of creating a super app that limits screen habits by forcing it on users, but rather create a health application that would push people to do physical activities and healthy habits.

OptiScreen Inc. tasked us to create a super app that would promote healthy habits to everyone stuck at home during the pandemic. To this end, our app promotes more of an active lifestyle, as well as healthy eating, all the while being elegant and easy to use. We are honored that OptiScreen Inc. came to us to design a super app that would help many of us still in lockdown.
